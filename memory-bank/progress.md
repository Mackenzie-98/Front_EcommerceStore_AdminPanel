### ‚úÖ Fixed Chart Loading Issues and Infinite Loading Bug (January 2024)
**Issue**: Dashboard charts were getting stuck in "Loading chart..." state indefinitely, causing the entire dashboard to become unresponsive and requiring page refresh.

**Root Cause**: 
- Dynamic imports were failing without proper error handling
- No timeout mechanisms for chart loading
- No fallback for failed imports
- Missing robust error boundaries

**Solution**: 
- **Created ChartErrorBoundary** (`components/ui/chart-error-boundary.tsx`): Comprehensive error boundary with retry functionality
- **Implemented useDynamicChart hook** (`hooks/use-dynamic-chart.ts`): Custom hook with timeout, abort controllers, and proper error handling
- **Built DynamicChart component** (`components/ui/dynamic-chart.tsx`): Robust wrapper for dynamic chart loading with fallbacks
- **Updated dashboard** (`app/page.tsx`): Replaced problematic dynamic imports with new robust components

**Key Features**:
- 10-second timeout for chart loading
- Automatic cleanup of failed requests
- Retry functionality for failed charts
- Better loading states and error messages
- Proper error boundaries to prevent UI freezing

**Result**: Dashboard now loads reliably with proper error handling, timeout mechanisms, and retry functionality. No more infinite loading states.

**Follow-up Fix**: 
- **Issue**: Runtime error "Cannot destructure property 'data' of 'param' as it is null"
- **Cause**: Props were not being passed correctly through the DynamicChart component
- **Solution**: Simplified props passing mechanism and added null/undefined guards in chart components
- **Files Updated**: 
  - `components/ui/dynamic-chart.tsx` - Fixed props passing
  - `components/dashboard/customer-segmentation-chart.tsx` - Added data validation
  - `components/dashboard/sales-chart.tsx` - Added data validation

**Final Solution**: 
- **Issue**: Charts still getting stuck in loading state despite fixes
- **Root Cause**: Dynamic imports were overly complex and the `error` property is not supported in Next.js dynamic imports
- **Final Solution**: Used simplified Next.js dynamic imports without error handlers
- **Changes Made**:
  - Created `components/ui/simple-dynamic-chart.tsx` with proper Next.js dynamic import syntax
  - Removed unsupported `error` property from dynamic import options
  - Kept loading states and data validation guards in chart components
  - Used standard Next.js approach for dynamic imports
- **Files Created**: 
  - `components/ui/simple-dynamic-chart.tsx` - Simplified dynamic imports
  - `components/ui/chart-error-boundary.tsx` - Error boundary components
- **Files Updated**: 
  - `app/page.tsx` - Uses imports from `simple-dynamic-chart.tsx`

### ‚úÖ Fixed Runtime Error in Dashboard (July 2024)
**Issue**: Fast Refresh was performing full reloads due to runtime errors in chart components. Dynamic imports were failing and causing 404 errors.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed dynamic import syntax for named exports: `.then(m => ({ default: m.SalesChart }))`
- Added proper loading states in dynamic import configuration
- Wrapped chart components in Suspense for better error handling
- Added fallback components for loading states

**Result**: Dashboard now loads successfully with working charts and no runtime errors.
